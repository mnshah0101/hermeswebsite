    "content": "For Counsia, we used NodeJS with a MongoDB database to build a full stack web application that provides support for high school students in the college admission process and employment for undergraduate students. The application is built with a custom CMS dashboard that allows the client to manage the entire application from a single dashboard. The application also has a full e-commerce integration that allows the client to sell their services and products online. We also built an automated email system that sends emails to users based on their actions on the application. We also provided digital marketing services for the client."
